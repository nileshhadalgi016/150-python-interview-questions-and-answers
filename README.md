# 150-python-interview-questions-and-answers
list of essential Python interview questions for 2025, organized into several key areas:

### Basics and Core Concepts

	1.	What is Python, and what are its key features?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include dynamic typing, object-oriented design, extensive standard libraries, and support for multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional). Python’s syntax is simple, making it easy for beginners while remaining powerful for advanced users.

	2.	How does Python manage memory?
Python manages memory with a built-in garbage collector, which automatically frees up memory by removing unused or unreachable objects. Memory management is handled through reference counting and the garbage collection mechanism in the gc module, ensuring efficient memory use without requiring manual intervention.

	3.	What are the key differences between Python 2 and Python 3?
Python 3 introduced several improvements and changes over Python 2, including better Unicode support, print() as a function, integer division behavior (/ vs. //), and more consistent syntax. Python 3 is faster and supports modern libraries, while Python 2 is no longer officially supported.

	4.	Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.
Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation. Tuples are immutable, so their content cannot change after creation. Lists are enclosed in square brackets ([]), while tuples use parentheses (()), and tuples often serve as fixed data structures for constant data.

	5.	How does Python handle type conversion?
Python allows implicit type conversion (automatic) where possible, but explicit conversion functions (e.g., int(), float(), str()) are often used for controlled conversions. Type conversion helps align data types during operations or when passing data between functions.

	6.	What is the use of the pass statement?
The pass statement is a placeholder in Python, used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is necessary. For example, it’s commonly used in empty function definitions or loops that will be implemented later, allowing the code to run without errors.

	7.	What is the difference between append() and extend() methods in lists?
append() adds a single item (or an object) to the end of a list, while extend() takes an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and adds each element to the list individually. append() results in a nested list if used with a list, whereas extend() merges the elements of the given iterable.

	8.	Explain the use of the self keyword in classes.
self is used as the first parameter in instance methods of a class to refer to the instance on which the method is called. It allows access to instance attributes and other methods within the same class, enabling object-specific behavior and data.

	9.	What are Python’s built-in data types?
Python’s built-in data types include:
	•	Numeric: int, float, complex
	•	Sequence: str, list, tuple
	•	Mapping: dict
	•	Set: set, frozenset
	•	Boolean: bool
	•	NoneType: None

	10.	How do you handle exceptions in Python?
Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions. Code within the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it’s caught by the except block. else runs if no exceptions are raised, and finally runs regardless of exceptions, typically used for cleanup tasks.

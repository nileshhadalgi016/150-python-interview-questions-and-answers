## üåü Basics and Core Concepts

	1.	What is Python, and what are its key features?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include dynamic typing, object-oriented design, extensive standard libraries, and support for multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional). Python‚Äôs syntax is simple, making it easy for beginners while remaining powerful for advanced users.

	2.	How does Python manage memory?
Python manages memory with a built-in garbage collector, which automatically frees up memory by removing unused or unreachable objects. Memory management is handled through reference counting and the garbage collection mechanism in the gc module, ensuring efficient memory use without requiring manual intervention.

	3.	What are the key differences between Python 2 and Python 3?
Python 3 introduced several improvements and changes over Python 2, including better Unicode support, print() as a function, integer division behavior (/ vs. //), and more consistent syntax. Python 3 is faster and supports modern libraries, while Python 2 is no longer officially supported.

	4.	Explain the difference between a list and a tuple.
Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation. Tuples are immutable, so their content cannot change after creation. Lists are enclosed in square brackets ([]), while tuples use parentheses (()), and tuples often serve as fixed data structures for constant data.

	5.	How does Python handle type conversion?
Python allows implicit type conversion (automatic) where possible, but explicit conversion functions (e.g., int(), float(), str()) are often used for controlled conversions. Type conversion helps align data types during operations or when passing data between functions.

	6.	What is the use of the pass statement?
The pass statement is a placeholder in Python, used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is necessary. For example, it‚Äôs commonly used in empty function definitions or loops that will be implemented later, allowing the code to run without errors.

	7.	What is the difference between append() and extend() methods in lists?
append() adds a single item (or an object) to the end of a list, while extend() takes an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and adds each element to the list individually. append() results in a nested list if used with a list, whereas extend() merges the elements of the given iterable.

	8.	Explain the use of the self keyword in classes.
self is used as the first parameter in instance methods of a class to refer to the instance on which the method is called. It allows access to instance attributes and other methods within the same class, enabling object-specific behavior and data.

	9.	What are Python‚Äôs built-in data types?
Python‚Äôs built-in data types include:
	‚Ä¢	Numeric: int, float, complex
	‚Ä¢	Sequence: str, list, tuple
	‚Ä¢	Mapping: dict
	‚Ä¢	Set: set, frozenset
	‚Ä¢	Boolean: bool
	‚Ä¢	NoneType: None

	10.	How do you handle exceptions in Python?
Python uses try, except, else, and finally blocks to handle exceptions. Code within the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it‚Äôs caught by the except block. else runs if no exceptions are raised, and finally runs regardless of exceptions, typically used for cleanup tasks.

### Control Flow and Looping

	11.	What is the purpose of if __name__ == "__main__" in Python?
This conditional statement checks whether a Python script is being run directly (as the main program) or being imported as a module in another script. Code within this block will execute only if the script is run directly, allowing you to include test code or script-specific functionality without affecting imports.

	12.	Explain how for and while loops work in Python.
‚Ä¢	A for loop iterates over items in a sequence (like a list or a string) or any iterable object. It executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.
‚Ä¢	A while loop continues to execute as long as a given condition is True. It checks the condition before each iteration and exits the loop once the condition evaluates to False.
 
	13.	What is a generator, and how do you use it?
A generator is a special type of iterator that yields values one at a time and maintains state between iterations, allowing you to iterate over potentially large sequences without loading everything into memory. You create a generator using a function that contains the yield statement. For example:

```
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2

```
	14.	What are list comprehensions in Python?
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of an expression followed by a for clause, and can include an optional if clause. For example:
```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```


	15.	How do you break out of a loop in Python?
You can break out of a loop using the break statement. When break is encountered, the loop terminates immediately, and control passes to the first statement following the loop. For example:
```
for x in range(10):
    if x == 5:
        break

```
	16.	What are lambda functions, and when would you use them?
Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They can take any number of arguments but have only one expression. They‚Äôre often used for short, throwaway functions, especially as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), or sorted(). For example:
```
square = lambda x: x**2

```
	17.	How does Python‚Äôs range() function work?
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used in loops. It can take one to three arguments: start, stop, and step. It produces numbers from start to stop (exclusive) with the specified step. For example:
```
for i in range(0, 10, 2):  # Generates 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
```


	18.	What is the difference between return and yield?
return exits a function and sends a value back to the caller, terminating the function‚Äôs execution. In contrast, yield pauses the function, allowing it to produce a value and maintain its state, enabling the function to be resumed later. Functions that use yield are called generators.

	19.	Explain how map(), filter(), and reduce() work.
‚Ä¢	map() applies a function to every item in an iterable and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list). For example:

```
squares = map(lambda x: x**2, [1, 2, 3])
```

‚Ä¢	filter() filters items in an iterable based on a function that returns True or False. It returns a filter object. For example:
```
evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4])
```

‚Ä¢	reduce() from the functools module applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value. For example:
```
from functools import reduce
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4])  # Returns 24
```

	20.	What is a continue statement, and when would you use it?
The continue statement is used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. It is useful when you want to skip certain conditions without breaking the entire loop. For example:
```
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
```
